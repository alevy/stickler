    <h1>Stickler Demo</h1>
    <p>This is site demonstrates how Stickler can fetch and verify content loaded from 
       minimally trusted content delivery networks (CDNs).
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the popular Bootstrap web framework&mdash;fetched from an untrusted CDN&mdash;to
      demostrate that Stickler is compatible with popular web development tools.

      <h2>What is it for?</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of Stickler is to provide end-to-end integrity protection for content
        served to clients through a CDN. In particular, if the site owner correctly
        deploys Stickler, a correct client will only execute JavaScript code signed by
        the site owner and will only load site-owner-signed content into the DOM, even
        in the presence of active attacks by the CDN.
      </p>

        <p>
        Providing strong integrity guarantees for CDN-hosted content is critical
        because integrity and confidentiality are closely linked. If the CDN can, for
        example, insert JavaScript code into HTML pages served to web clients, the CDN
        can read and exfiltrate passwords and other secret data via the client’s DOM.
        By providing integrity guarantees, Stickler allows us to protect against
        confidentiality attacks that a CDN can mount by serving maliciously modified
        assets to the client.
        </p>

    <div class="col-md-12"> 
      <span id="how" class="anchor">&nbsp;</span>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        When a client browses to a Stickler-protected website (e.g., mysite.com), the
        DNS record for the requested domain points the client to a web server
        controlled by the site owner,
        <em>not</em> by the CDN. The client makes a TLS connection to this server and
        requests the index page for the website.  The site owner's web server returns
        an HTML page with the Stickler bootloader script embedded. This script contains
        (1) the site owner’s public signature verification key, (2) JavaScript code to
        download and verify the site's assets, and (3) the location of the site's
        manifest file. Since this first request is made over a TLS-authenticated
        connection directly to the site owner’s server, authenticating the connection
        is sufficient to authenticate the content. The site owner never needs to share
        the public-key certificate it uses to authenticate this initial connection.

        <p>
        When the client executes the bootloader script, the script initiates an XHR
        request (i.e., AJAX request) to the CDN for the site's manifest file. Upon
        receiving the site manifest, the bootloader script first checks that the
        manifest carries a valid signature by the site owner, and then the bootloader
        executes the manifest file as JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
        Executing the manifest file causes the client to generate a series of XHR
        requests to the CDN for the rest of the site's assets, each of which bears a
        digital signature by the site owner. When the CDN serves these assets to the
        client, the bootloader script verifies the site owner's signature on each asset
        and then processes it by invoking a function defined in the manifest.
        Typically, this processing just involves inserting the object into a
        pre-specified location in the DOM. When the user interacts with the site (e.g.,
        by clicking a link), this could trigger more remote asset loads and signature
        verifications as needed to update the page content.
        </p>
        <p>
        The site owner's server only need serve the initial bootloader script—the
        client can request all of the site's other assets directly from the CDN.

      <h2>How <em>well</em> does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        The latency of loading an asset with Stickler is governed by three factors.
        After the asset is retrieved from the network, Stickler must verify either the
        signature or hash of the content. Finally, if the asset is an image or other
        media, Stickler must convert it to a data uri and load it in a DOM element’s
        src attribute.
        <p>
        The site developer can choose for each asset whether to sign and verify the
        signature client-side, or embed a hash of the contents in the manifest, and
        verify that the contents matches that hash client-side. Signatures are more
        flexible in that they do not require the developer to commit to the specific
        content. Instead, the site can generate content dynamically. Hashes, on the
        other hand can be used for assets retrieved from another server (e.g.
        third-party JavaScript or CSS).
        <p>
        Our experiments show that for small assets, both
        signature and hash verification completes in under 1ms. For larger assets,
        traversing the contents dominates performance and there is no measurable
        difference between signing and hashing. Verifying the 5MB asset takes
        approximately 55ms in both cases. In general, verification in either method
        constitutes about a 1% overhead compared to downloaded that asset over a 10Mbps
        network connection.
